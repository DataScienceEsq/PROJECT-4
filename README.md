# PROJECT-4
Market Basket Analysis: In this project we look at a data set that contains customer purchases of items for several customers from a super market over a period of time. Using Data Science techniques we find associations among items that a consumer may purchase. The PYTHON programming language and its MLXTEND package as well as algorithms therein are used on the IBM Watson Cloud in this project.
